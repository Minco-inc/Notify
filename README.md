# Notify
Suppose you have executed a command that takes a long time. You can't just stare at the console window where nothing is printed and wait still. Because your time is precious. Instead, try installing this program. I can send you a notification when the process is over! Now you can just execute it and head to bed to watch YouTube. Or you can do something more productive.
```bash
loooooong-time-process-that-guttles-your-time && notify "The process is done!"
```

# Installation

wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Minco-inc/Notify/main/install-wget.sh | bash
```
or

cd notify
sudo ./ez-setup
```
And follow instruction on console.
